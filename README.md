# hello-world
I'm a man of many experiences to say the least! I currently hold a position as an Aerostructure at NORDAM in Tulsa Oklahoma. I was formerly a Deputy Sheriff at the Douglas County Sheriff's Office in Atlanta Georgia and the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office in Tulsa Oklahoma. I joined the law enforcement community with the goals to serve my community and to retire in this field. After the birth of my youngest daughter and some unforeseen health concerns we had for her, I had entered a crossroads in my career. I chose to leave law enforcement and go back into aviation where I had previously worked for many years. This has left me trying to figure out what I want to do professionally for the rest of my life. I have found in the last couple years that I have a serious interest in software development. I dabbled for a while trying to get my feet wet in coding. After moving back home from Atlanta to Tulsa I have discovered even more that software development is what I want to pursue as a career. I have worked countless hours self teaching, reading and working on sites such as codecademy.com and Udemy. My goal is to become a junior developer by spring 2019 with the goals to become a full fledge software engineer in the next 5 years. I believe with the work I'm currently putting in and some classes along the way I will be able to accomplish this goal and be able to look back on it as a true success.
